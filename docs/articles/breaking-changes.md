## xFunc 4.4.0

* The `Helpers` class is removed from the public API (see [#698](https://github.com/sys27/xFunc/pull/698)).
* `LambdaExpression` doesn't capture context on `Execute` this code moved to `CallExpression` (see [#704](https://github.com/sys27/xFunc/issues/704)).
* `xFunc.DotnetTool` -> `xFunc.Cli`
* `While` doesn't inherit `BinaryExpression`, instead it implements `IExpression` directly.
* `ResultIsNotSupportedException` -> `ExecutionException`. The error message changed.
* `While`/`For` throws the correct exception when `Condition` doesn't return `bool` (`InvalidCastException` -> `ExecutionException`).
* `While`/`For` returns `EmptyValue`.
* `Derivative`/`If`/`While`/`For` is executed in nested `ExpressionParameters` scope now. It means all variables created in process of expressions evaluation won't affect parent/global scope.
* The `Parameters` property is removed from `DifferentiatorContext`.
* The return type of `Processor.Solve` method has change (see [#720](https://github.com/sys27/xFunc/pull/720) - New Results API).

## xFunc 4.3.0

* `MatrixIsInvalidException` -> `InvalidMatrixException`.
* `Vector`/`Matrix` returns `VectorValue`/`MatrixValue` instead of `Vector`/`Matrix`.
* `Del`/`Simplify`/`Derivate` functions accept/return lambdas instead of expression.
* The grammar for `CallExpression`. Now you can use any expression as the function to call, eg. `deriv((x) => x ^ 2)(3)` because `deriv` returns a lambda, you can call it immediately. Previously, only user function and inline lambda expression were supported.
* `ExpressionResult` is removed, partially replaced by `LambdaResult`.
* `ResultTypes.Expression` and `ResultTypes.Lambda` are merged into `ResultTypes.Lambda`.
* DotNet Tool has the `xfunc` name in the terminal (all letters are lowercase).
* `NumberValue.NegativeInfinity` points to `double.NegativeInfinity` instead of `double.PositiveInfinity`.
* The ability to parse the implicit mull operator (eg. 2x) is returned. 

## xFunc 4.2.0

* `xFunc.Maths` targets `.NET 6` instead of `.NET Standard 2.1`
* `ComplexNumber` doesn't perform the strict comparison of floating point numbers (Real and Imaginary parts).
* `AngleUnit` is `class` instead of `enum`.
* `Contains`/`ContainsKey` (`ParameterCollection`) doesn't check the constants collection anymore (see [#623](https://github.com/sys27/xFunc/issues/623)).
* Removed russian localization (see [#625](https://github.com/sys27/xFunc/issues/625)).
* `UserFunction` was removed, partially replaced by `CallExpression` and `Lambda` (see [#628](https://github.com/sys27/xFunc/issues/628)).
* `ParameterCollection` is renamed to `ExpressionParamaters`, and the old version of `ExpressionParameters` is removed.
* `FunctionCollection` was removed, now `ExpressionParameters` can hold functions as well (see [#628](https://github.com/sys27/xFunc/issues/628)).
* `->` and `=>` operators can be used only for lambda expressions, the implication and the equality operators can be used only by keywords: `impl` and `eq`.
* `Define`/`Undefine` can accept only `Variable` instead of `IExpression`.
* the grammar to define user function was changed from `f(x) := sin(x)` to `f := (x) => sin(x)`.
* `Define` -> `Assign`, `Undefine` -> `Unassign`.
* The `:=` operator and `assign`/`unassign` functions are parsed as expressions instead of statements (they can be used inside other expressions, for example: `1 + (x := 1)`/`(f := (x) => x)(2)`
* `Assign`/`Unassign` returns the assigned/unassigned value instead of `string`.
* The ability to parse the implicit mull operator (eg. `2x`) is removed. Now only `2 * x` is supported.

## xFunc 4.1.0

* `Analyzer<TResult, TContext>` is abstract now.
* UI moved to the separate repository [xFunc.UI](https://github.com/sys27/xFunc.UI).
* The `xFunc.UnitConverter` project was removed (unit conversion migrated to xFunc.Maths).

## xFunc 4.0.0

**The grammar is changed:**

* `for`, `while` functions are statements now.
* the `^` operator is right-associative (see [#244](https://github.com/sys27/xFunc/issues/244)).
* `vector`/`matrix` prefix is no longer required to create a vector/matrix, like: `{1, 2}`.
