# How to build the project

## Install SDK

You need to install the latest dotnet SDK (at least). Usually the project is migrated to newer version after several weeks/months after SDK release.

Right now, .NET 7.0 is required (*the documentation could be stale*).

## Checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sys27/xFunc.git
```

## Build

From terminal:

```bash
dotnet build
```

or VS Code tasks:

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Open Command Palette (Cmd + Shift + P on mac OS).
3. Select `Tasks: Run Task`.
4. Select `Build`.

Or you can open `xFunc.sln` file in any other IDE (Visual Studio / Rider) and run build.

*Note: if you plan to play with the code and change it here and there, it is recommended to use `Debug` configuration instead of `Release`. The `Release` configuration has a lot of analyzers/StyleCope/rules and they are treated as error. So, you won't be able to build the project at all.*

## Tests

Run (from the project folder):

```bash
dotnet test
```

or use any IDE to run tests. No additional setup is required.

## Code Coverage / Report Generation

Terminal:

```bash
dotnet test xFunc.sln -c Release -p:CollectCoverage=true
```

or VS Code tasks:

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Open Command Palette (Cmd + Shift + P on mac OS).
3. Select `Tasks: Run Task`.
4. Select `Code Coverage`.

After that the `coverage` folder will appear in the root of the project. Open `index.html` and you will see the code coverage report generated by [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator).
